# High-Performance Coding

Universal principles for writing fast, resource-efficient code. These patterns apply across languages and domains — systems programming, scientific computing, data pipelines, and web services.

## Universal Principles

### 0. Identify the Bottleneck First

Before optimizing, answer one question: **is the program compute-bound or bandwidth-bound?**

- **Compute-bound**: the ALUs are the bottleneck. All cores at 100%, instructions are being issued as fast as the hardware can consume them. Solution: reduce instruction count, use SIMD, improve ILP.
- **Bandwidth-bound**: the memory subsystem is the bottleneck. Cores stall waiting for data. Solution: improve data layout, reduce data movement, increase reuse from caches.

A useful mental model is the **roofline**: every operation has an *arithmetic intensity* (FLOPs per byte loaded). Plot that against your hardware's peak compute and peak bandwidth. If your intensity is below the ridge point, you're bandwidth-bound — optimizing compute won't help. If above, you're compute-bound — better caching won't help.

In practice:
- If `perf stat` shows high IPC (> 2) and low cache miss rate, you're likely compute-bound.
- If IPC is low (< 1) and `cache-misses` or `cache-references` are high, you're bandwidth-bound.
- On GPU: high SM utilization + low memory throughput → compute-bound. Low SM utilization → likely bandwidth-bound or launch-overhead-bound.

**Amdahl's Law sets the theoretical ceiling on parallelism.** If a fraction *S* of your program is serial, the maximum speedup with *N* cores is `1 / (S + (1-S)/N)`. For *S* = 10%, infinite cores give at most 10× speedup. This is why finding and shrinking the serial fraction matters more than adding cores — and why the bottleneck (compute, bandwidth, or serial code) dictates the optimization strategy.

**Little's Law connects concurrency to throughput.** `concurrency = throughput × latency`. If each task takes 1 second and you need 100 tasks/s, you need ≥ 100 concurrent workers. Use this to pick `max_workers` from requirements, not guesswork. Combined with Amdahl: the serial fraction limits how much concurrency can actually help.

**This determines everything that follows.** Memory-bound optimizations applied to a compute-bound program add overhead with no benefit. Compute optimizations applied to a bandwidth-bound program don't move the needle. Adding parallelism beyond Amdahl's limit wastes resources. Answer the bottleneck question first.

### 1. Resource-Aware Parallelism

**Before anything: check what the server actually has available right now.** `cpu_count` tells you total cores, not free cores. `total_ram` tells you installed memory, not available memory. Other users, background services, and yesterday's forgotten processes all consume resources. Use `htop` / `free -h` / `nvidia-smi` to see current state, not theoretical capacity. Then pick a strategy:

**CPU-bound workloads:**
- Start conservative: a few workers below the number of *free* cores, not total cores. Watch CPU usage, then increase gradually.
- Python: `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU work (the GIL serializes threads on CPU tasks), `ThreadPoolExecutor` for IO waits.
- C++: `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` returns available cores. `std::execution::par_unseq` (C++17) or OpenMP `#pragma omp parallel for` for loop parallelism.
- Rust: `rayon` with `par_iter()` automatically sizes the thread pool. Use `par_bridge()` for sequential iterators.

**Memory-bound workloads:**
- Check *available* memory (`free -h`, not `total`). Estimate per-worker memory: a worker that loads 2 GB means you can't run 16 of them on 32 GB.
- Stream/iterate instead of materializing. Generators, `Iterator` traits, and lazy pipelines keep memory constant regardless of dataset size.
- GPU memory profiling has its own methodology — see §3.

**IO-bound workloads:**
- Async/await is usually the right answer. But watch for hidden sync calls that block the event loop.
- Connection pools set the real ceiling. A pool of 5 DB connections can't serve 50 concurrent tasks, no matter how many coroutines you spawn.
- Use a `Semaphore(max_concurrent)` gate rather than spawning unlimited tasks. Tune the limit by observing actual resource pressure.

**GPU-bound workloads:**
- Batch size is capped by VRAM. Use gradient accumulation to simulate larger batches: `loss / n_accumulate` then `backward()`, then `optimizer.step()` after every N micro-batches.
- Sparse representation matters enormously. A dense adjacency for N nodes costs O(N²) memory. At N=50K, that's 2.5B entries — even zeros consume memory. Use COO/CSR edge lists.
- Data transfer is async. `tensor.to(device, non_blocking=True)` overlaps CPU→GPU copy with kernel execution when data is pinned.

**Container-bound workloads (Docker/batch evaluation):**
Each container is a resource consumer — memory, disk, CPU. Parallelism strategies:

- **Reuse containers, don't rebuild.** Building a Docker image per task is expensive. Build once, then reset state between runs (`docker exec git checkout HEAD && git clean -fd`). An agent task that shares one container across N modes is N× faster than rebuilding each time.
- **Stale container cleanup before launching.** Previous crashed runs leave `sweb.eval.*` containers sitting around consuming memory. Always run `docker ps -a --filter | xargs docker rm -f` before starting a new batch.
- **Two-level parallelism.** Run instance-level and eval-level as separate pools with different `max_workers`. Instance workers generate predictions (CPU/network-bound), eval workers run Docker containers (memory/IO-bound). They have different bottleneck profiles — tuning them independently avoids contention.
- **ThreadPoolExecutor, not ProcessPoolExecutor.** Docker SDK calls are IO-bound (waiting for `docker exec` or `docker build` to complete). Threads work fine here — the GIL doesn't block waiting on subprocess output.
- **Cap workers to actual tasks.** `max_workers = min(cpu_count, len(tasks))` — spawning 32 workers for 5 tasks wastes thread creation overhead.
- **Pre-compute shared work.** If multiple modes share analysis results, compute them once in a batch before the main parallel phase. Reduces per-container work and avoids redundant API calls.

### 2. Async Pipeline Design

Cross-cutting patterns for async code that apply regardless of framework:

**The event loop must not block:**
Synchronous SDKs (database drivers, HTTP clients, file I/O) stall the entire event loop. Offload them: `asyncio.to_thread()` in Python, `tokio::task::spawn_blocking()` in Rust. One blocked coroutine starves all others.

**Know your framework's concurrency model:**
Not all async primitives are concurrency-safe. Before spawning concurrent tasks, understand what your framework actually supports:
- SQLAlchemy's `AsyncSession` rejects concurrent queries — `asyncio.gather()` on the same session errors. Use separate sessions or serialize.
- `tokio::spawn()` is cheap but spawning 100K tasks holding connections exhausts file descriptors.
- Database connection pools have finite capacity — set `pool_size` and `max_overflow` based on your measured concurrency, not guesswork.

**Test the failure paths:**
What happens when the database is unreachable? When the external API times out? When the semaphore is at capacity? Async error handling often silently swallows exceptions — explicitly test these paths.

**Decouple stages with bounded queues:**
Producer-consumer patterns with `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=N)` or `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(N)` let stages run at different speeds. Backpressure is automatic — the producer blocks when the queue is full.

**LLM API and embedding throughput:**
When the pipeline calls external AI APIs, throughput is gated by rate limits, latency, and token cost:

- **Batch embeddings, never one-at-a-time.** Every embedding API (OpenAI, Cohere, ChromaDB) supports batched input. Calling `embed(["text1", "text2", ...])` instead of N separate calls can reduce wall time by 10-50×. Test your provider's max batch size — some cap at 96, others at 2048.
- **Prompt caching is the cheapest optimization.** Anthropic's prompt cache has a 5-minute TTL — put the system prompt and long-lived context in `cache_control` blocks. When cache hits, those tokens cost 90% less and skip the model's prefill phase entirely. Structure prompts so the cached prefix stays identical across calls.
- **Parallel API calls with rate-limit awareness.** APIs enforce RPM/TPM limits. Use `asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)` to stay under the limit, and catch 429 responses with exponential backoff. Many SDKs have built-in retry — make sure it's enabled.
- **Pre-compute and cache LLM outputs.** If multiple downstream tasks share an analysis step (e.g., code analysis, paper classification), run it once, cache the result, and reuse. This avoids redundant API cost and latency — the AnalysisAgent pattern from SWE-bench agent eval saves one LLM call per instance per mode.

### 3. GPU Acceleration

Universal GPU programming patterns, applicable whether you use PyTorch, CUDA C++, or JAX:

**Benchmark methodology is not optional:**
1. Warmup: run 5+ iterations before timing. First kernel launch incurs JIT/context init overhead.
2. Synchronize: `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` (CUDA C++) / `torch.cuda.synchronize()` (PyTorch). CUDA ops are asynchronous — without sync you measure launch overhead, not compute time.
3. Profile peak: `cudaMemGetInfo()` (CUDA C++) / `reset_peak_memory_stats()` → `max_memory_allocated()` (PyTorch). Subtract baseline memory.
4. Structure results: record config + metrics + device info as structured data, not printf.

**Memory allocation patterns (CUDA C++):**
- Prefer `cudaMalloc` once, reuse buffers. Runtime allocation inside hot loops is expensive.
- Use pinned (page-locked) host memory (`cudaMallocHost`) for DMA transfers. Enables overlap with `cudaMemcpyAsync` on different streams.
- CUDA streams for concurrency: `cudaStream_t stream; cudaStreamCreate(&stream); kernel<<<grid, block, 0, stream>>>();` — multiple streams can overlap kernel execution with data transfer.

**Reproducibility vs speed:**
- Debugging/tuning: `cudnn.deterministic = True`, `cudnn.benchmark = False`, `manual_seed(seed)`, `cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)`. Slower but outputs are identical run-to-run.
- Production: `cudnn.benchmark = True` (cuDNN auto-tuner picks fastest algorithm). Only works when input shapes are consistent.

**Sparse vs dense is a data property:**
The crossover point where sparse beats dense depends on density, hardware, and operation. Don't guess — benchmark a grid of sizes × densities. For graphs, `edge_index` (sparse) is almost always right when average degree << total nodes.

**Gradient accumulation is the universal solution to "batch doesn't fit":**
Zero gradients once → loop over micro-batches → `loss = loss / n_batches` → `backward()` each → `optimizer.step()` once at the end. The effective batch size is the sum of micro-batches, but peak memory is that of a single micro-batch.

### 4. Validate Before Scaling

The most reliable way to avoid wasting resources:

- **Gate everything with a subset parameter.** `max_items=5` before `max_items=5000`. Catch code bugs, config errors, and logic issues on a tiny, fast run.
- **Maintain a fast test** that exercises the critical path end-to-end in a few seconds. Run it after every change. If it breaks, don't proceed to full scale.
- **Scale progressively.** 5 items → verify output → 50 items → verify output → full dataset. Each stage gates the next. A bug found at 50 items costs minutes, not hours.
- **In GPU work**, the analogue is: small synthetic data → medium real subset → full dataset. Validate loss curves and gradient flow at each stage before committing to a multi-hour run.

### 5. Fast Paths for Common Cases

When profiling shows a specific code path dominates, handle it without the general-case overhead:

**Check before locking.**
An atomic counter can tell you "no work to do" without ever touching the lock:
```c
// Wait queue wake: check atomic flag before acquiring the spinlock.
// If num_wakers == 0, there's nothing to wake — skip the lock entirely.
if (atomic_load(&wq->num_wakers, relaxed) == 0)
    return;
spin_lock(&wq->lock);
// ... actual wake logic
```

**Single-owner skip.**
When a reference count is 1, you own the data exclusively:
```rust
// RwArc::get() — if we're the only handle, return &T without any atomic ops.
if self.num_rw.load(Ordering::Relaxed) == 1 {
    return unsafe { &*self.ptr };  // no other thread can observe
}
// Otherwise, fall back to the general (slower) path...
```

**Power-of-two capacities.**
Ring buffer size = 2^n turns modulo into a bitmask:
```c
// idx % capacity   →   idx & (capacity - 1)
// Compiles to a single AND instruction instead of DIV.
buf[tail & (buf->capacity - 1)] = item;
```

**Relaxed memory ordering when safe.**
If your context already provides ordering (preemption disabled, lock held, single-threaded phase), `Ordering::Relaxed` is cheaper than `SeqCst`:
```rust
// Inside a spinlock — lock acquire/release already provides ordering.
// Relaxed is sufficient and generates plain MOV instead of LOCK XADD.
self.counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
```

### 6. Memory Access Patterns

Data layout often matters more than instruction count. The gap between CPU speed and DRAM latency has been growing for 40 years — a main memory access costs ~100ns, during which a modern core could execute ~400 instructions.

**Cache lines and false sharing:**
A cache line is 64 bytes on x86/ARM. When any core writes to a cache line, every other core's copy is invalidated. If two threads write to different variables that happen to share a cache line, they destroy each other's cache despite never touching the same data:
```c
// BAD: two ints on the same cache line — threads fight invisibly.
struct {
    int counter_a;  // thread A writes here
    int counter_b;  // thread B writes here — SAME cache line
} __attribute__((packed));

// GOOD: pad to cache line boundaries.
struct {
    alignas(64) int counter_a;
    alignas(64) int counter_b;
};
```
In Rust: `#[repr(align(64))]`. Symptoms: high cache-miss rate on writes, poor scaling beyond 2 threads despite no obvious contention.

**AoS vs SoA:**
When iterating over one field of many objects, Structure-of-Arrays keeps the accessed data contiguous:
```c
// AoS: iterating all x coordinates loads x,y,z into cache for every element.
struct Particle { float x, y, z; } particles[N];

// SoA: three separate arrays. Walking all x touches only x — 3× fewer cache lines.
struct Particles { float *x, *y, *z; };
```
Rule of thumb: if you access all fields together, use AoS (good locality). If you access one field across many objects, SoA wins. GPUs especially punish AoS — coalesced access requires threads in a warp to hit consecutive addresses, and AoS interleaves unused data.

**NUMA awareness:**
On multi-socket machines, memory is attached to specific CPUs. Accessing "remote" memory costs 1.3-2× more latency than "local". When allocating large buffers, allocate them on the NUMA node where they'll be used. In Linux, `numactl --cpunodebind=N --membind=N` pins both. In code, `libnuma` or `numa_alloc_onnode()`.

**Practical rules:**
- Pad shared counters to cache-line boundaries when written by different threads.
- Prefer SoA for hot loops that touch one field across many elements.
- On multi-socket machines, pin threads and allocate memory on the same NUMA node.
- `perf stat -e cache-misses,cache-references` tells you if layout optimization is worth doing at all.

### 7. Error Resilience

Don't let one failure cascade:

- **Timeout every external call.** API, database, subprocess, network — everything needs a deadline. Infinite wait = silent hang.
- **Graceful degradation over crash.** If the premium model errors, fall back to the simple baseline. If semantic search fails, fall back to keyword match. The user gets a result instead of nothing.
- **Retry transient failures, not logic errors.** Network blips and rate limits deserve 2-3 retries with exponential backoff. Validation errors, schema mismatches, and permission denials should fail fast.
- **Catch regressions instantly.** A 2-second fast test that catches a regression saves hours of debugging a full-scale run that silently produces wrong results.

### 8. Design for Interruption

Long-running work should survive crashes, restarts, and partial failures. Five levels of investment, from trivial to production-grade:

**Level 1 — Skip if output exists.** `if os.path.exists(out): return`. One line, makes any script idempotent.

**Level 2 — Track processed IDs.** Save a `processed.json` set, updated after each item. Re-run skips already-done work. For batch processing that takes minutes to hours.

**Level 3 — Structured checkpoints at boundaries.** After each pipeline stage, before external jobs (API calls, Docker, GPU epochs), and before human gates. A JSON row recording: current step, produced artifacts, pending jobs, how to continue.

**Level 4 — Automatic recovery strategy.** Escalate by failure count and type: auto-retry (transient, < 3 attempts) → checkpoint-resume (persistent, roll back) → skip-and-continue (non-critical, log and move on) → manual intervention (critical, pause for human).

**Level 5 — Survive process death.** DB-backed queue (not in-memory) + lease per work item (expired lease = another worker claims it) + graceful shutdown (catch SIGTERM, finish current item, save checkpoint, release locks).

**Core principle:** make the unit of work small enough that restarting from the last checkpoint is cheap. If recomputing from scratch costs 3 hours, create checkpoints more often than every 3 hours. The overhead of saving state is negligible compared to the cost of redoing work.

### 9. Compile-Time Optimization

For compiled languages:

- **Rust**: `lto = true` + `codegen-units = 1` enables cross-crate inlining. `lto = "thin"` for dev builds (most of the benefit, much faster). `panic = "abort"` removes landing pads for smaller binaries and better inlining. Typical: 2-10% speed gain, 2-3× compile time.
- **C++**: `-flto -fwhole-program -fuse-linker-plugin` for GCC/Clang. `-ffast-math` when IEEE compliance isn't needed. `-march=native` to enable instruction sets available on the build machine (AVX2, etc.).
- **Go**: `-ldflags="-s -w"` strips debug info and symbol table. `CGO_ENABLED=0` produces static binaries and avoids cgo overhead. Build with the target's GOARCH for best results — cross-compilation is cheap in Go.

### 10. Data Structures Are Leverage

The right data structure often beats micro-optimization by orders of magnitude:

- **Read-mostly, concurrent**: RCU (Read-Copy-Update) — readers never block, writers clone. Ideal when reads >> writes. ⚠️ *Hard to implement correctly — requires grace period tracking, safe memory reclamation, and preemption control. Use a battle-tested library unless you're writing an OS kernel.*
- **Producer-consumer, bounded**: Lock-free SPSC ring buffer — producer and consumer never contend on the same cache line. ⚠️ *Power-of-two capacity required for bitmask indexing. Validate with TSan before trusting correctness.*
- **Write-heavy storage**: LSM-tree — buffer writes in memory, flush and compact in background. Turns random writes into sequential I/O.
- **Sparse indexing**: Radix tree / XArray — fixed fanout, O(log N) lookup. Good for sparse key spaces. RCU-compatible variants exist for concurrent read access.
- **Large graphs on GPU**: Neighbor sampling (not full adjacency) — sample a fixed number of neighbors per node per layer to keep memory bounded.

The ⚠️ structures are correct only under specific invariants. Without those invariants, they produce silently wrong results — worse than a slow lock.

## When NOT to Optimize

- **Profile before you touch anything.** Without a profiler, you're guessing what's slow. The bottleneck is rarely where you think it is. Run a profiler (perf, py-spy, flamegraph, cProfile, nvprof) and optimize only the functions that actually dominate runtime.
- **If it's already fast enough, stop.** "Acceptable" means within the user's latency expectation or time budget. Don't spend 2 hours optimizing something that runs in 0.1 seconds.
- **One-off scripts don't need infrastructure.** A single-user CLI, a data exploration notebook, a throwaway analysis — these don't need async frameworks, thread pools, or GPU acceleration. The engineering cost outweighs any speed gain.
- **Lock-free code is more dangerous than slow code.** Every lock-free data structure has subtle correctness hazards. Only reach for RCU, SPSC rings, or custom atomics when a lock-based version is measurably too slow AND you've verified the lock-free version under thread sanitizer (TSan).
- **Parallelism without measurement is just complexity.** Don't add threads, async, or multiprocessing without first measuring what the bottleneck actually is. CPU-bound? IO-bound? Memory-bound? The answer determines the fix — guess wrong and you add overhead with no benefit.
- **Last resort, not first instinct.** Algorithmic improvements (better data structure, caching, batching) usually beat micro-optimizations (inlining, loop unrolling, bit tricks) by orders of magnitude. Try the big wins first.
